## Project Overview
This bingo number calling app is built for use with the [My Free Bingo Cards website](https://myfreebingocards.com/). It is intended to solve a shortcoming with the website when it comes to the number calling, which is relegated to three preset call sequences. In this case, if participants kept their original cards, you would only be able to play three rounds of bingo. Otherwise, you would already know the winner of whichever call sequence you selected on Round 4.

In light of this issue, I said "How hard can it be to write a random bingo number caller?" This application and the [regular JS implementation](https://github.com/Captain63/bingo-caller) that preceded it are the result of that question.
